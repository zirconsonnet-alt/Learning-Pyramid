## Notes

- Validation passed on 2026-05-04. Domain terms such as roll-up trigger, aggregation queue, and upper-layer registration are retained because they describe required product behavior, not implementation mechanics.
- Updated on 2026-05-04 to require learning-object-isomorphic roll-up to select currently consumable source aggregation queue candidates before any parent can be created or updated.
